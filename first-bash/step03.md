The `cd` command _changes directories_ to move you to a different folder. The symbol `.` (just a period) represents the current directory. The symbol `..` (a double dot) represents the directory one level _above_ the current directory.

##Â Task

Type `pwd` to check your current directory. Then type `cd .` and `pwd` again to see what changes.

Type `cd ..` to move up one level, then check your new current directory with `pwd`.
